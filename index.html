        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein was a revolutionary physicist born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. His relentless curiosity and passion for understanding the universe led him to become one of the most influential scientists in history. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which dramatically transformed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His iconic equation, E = mc², showcased the relationship between energy and mass, reshaping modern physics.</p>
        <p>Einstein's contributions extended beyond relativity, advancing quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and cosmology, which laid the groundwork for nuclear energy. Awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, he was also a strong advocate for social justice, human rights, and pacifism. His legacy continues to inspire curiosity and innovation.</p>

        <p>Albert Einstein revolutionized physics with his theory of relativity and contributions to quantum mechanics. His famous equation, E = mc², transformed our understanding of mass and energy. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, which was key to quantum theory.</p>
        <p>Beyond science, Einstein was a passionate advocate for peace and human rights, often speaking out against war and injustice. He found comfort in playing the violin, balancing his intellectual pursuits with a love for music. His legacy continues to inspire both science and humanity.</p>
